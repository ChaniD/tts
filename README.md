# Table Top Simulator Mod for Star Wars: Legion

This project is a community-contributed open source mod for [Table Top Simulator][1],
emulating some features and gameplay of [Star Wars Legion][2]. It is periodically updated
to the [Steam Workshop][3], and in the future we will have a documented release schedule
and policy as part of the [Wiki][4].

_Star Wars: Legion and all related properties and text are owned by Fantasy Flight Games, Lucasfilm Ltd., and/or Disney._

## Background

The TTS SWL Mod was created and is maintained by one person, [Tieren][5], but as the
anticipated future workload will grow beyond the reasonable capabilities of a single person
and to ensure Tierens future commitment and enjoyment in contributing to the mod, the aim of
this project will be to move the mod to open source and allow the community to contribute to
the continued development of the mod.

## Goals

1. A community site (this site) is provided and accepting bugs/requests
2. Resources used by the mod are hosted on community accessible services
3. Mod is developed and distributed from the hosted services by the community
4. A Wiki is provided with tutorials, how-to contribute, and more
